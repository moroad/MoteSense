MoteSense
----------------------

      This is a senior project written by Jharrod LaFon and Michael Harris
      at New Mexico State University.  

      The MoteSense application is designed to plot data
      in real time from a wireless sensor network.  Development is in 
      beta.

      The Qt4 framework is required for the application.

      The Qwt package is needed for graphing:

      Qwt is hosted at http://qwt.sf.net

Installation
------------
      
      There is no install script yet.  You can build the application

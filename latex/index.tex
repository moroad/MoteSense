\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
This project is designed to acquire, and plot data in real time from a Wireless Sensor Network. The end goal is to use this data to recognize when a vehicle is present at the sensor. It was written by Jharrod LaFon and Michael Harris at New Mexico State University for our Senior Project in 2010. This program connects to a tcp socket from which it acquires the data to plot. For our development we have been using the serial forwarder application provided with TinyOS.

Here is the hardware we used for development:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tmote Sky IV Motes
\item SBT80 Sensor Boards
\end{DoxyItemize}

Here is what we needed for our development environment:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item TinyOS
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Version 2.1.1
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Tinyos-\/tools
\item Qt4
\item Qwt \href{http://qwt.sourceforge.net/}{\tt http://qwt.sourceforge.net/}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
To work with qwt, in the MoteSense.pro these lines must specify where the library is: INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/qwt-\/5.2.0/include/ LIBS += /usr/local/qwt-\/5.2.0/lib/libqwt.so.5.2.0
